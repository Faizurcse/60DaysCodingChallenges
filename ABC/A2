Given an integer array and another integer element. The task is to find if the given element is present in array or not.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1,2,3,4}
x = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one test case 
with array as {1, 2, 3 4} and element 
to be searched as 3.  Since 3 is 
present at index 2, output is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
x = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: For array elements 
{1,2,3,4,5} element to be searched 
is 5 and it is at index 4. So, the 
output is 4.

//program

class Solution{
        
    static int search(int arr[], int N, int X)
    {
        
        // Your code here
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(arr[i]==X){
                return i;
               
            }
        }
        return -1;
        
    }
    
}
