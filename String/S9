Given a string S of lowercase alphabets, check if it is isogram or not. An Isogram is a string in which no letter occurs more than once.

Example 1:

Input:
S = machine
Output: 1
Explanation: machine is an isogram
as no letter has appeared twice. Hence
we print 1.
Example 2:

Input:
S = geeks
Output: 0
Explanation: geeks is not an isogram
as 'e' appears twice. Hence we print 0.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function isIsogram() that takes a string as a parameter and returns either true or false.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Number of distinct characters).
Note: N = |S|

class Solution
{
    //Function to check if a string is Isogram or not.
    static boolean isIsogram(String data){
        //Your code here
        HashSet<Character>set=new HashSet<>();
        for(int i=0;i<data.length();i++){
            char ch=data.charAt(i);
            if(!set.contains(ch)){
              set.add(ch);
                
            }
        }
        if(data.length()==set.size()){
            return true;
        }
        else{
           return false;
        }
    }
}
